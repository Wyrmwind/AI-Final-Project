# Movie Industry Trends Analysis - AI Project

# Project Overview
This project explores trends in the movie industry using data science and machine learning techniques. We analyze a comprehensive dataset of approximately 1 million movie records to uncover insights about production trends, financial performance, genre popularity, and audience ratings over several decades.

# Key Objectives
- Investigate temporal changes in movie production from 1950-2025
- Analyze relationships between budget, revenue, and Return on Investment (ROI)
- Explore genre popularity and profitability patterns
- Identify directors with strong critical and commercial performance
- Predict movie success categories (Hit/Average/Flop) using machine learning

# Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Decision Trees, GridSearchCV)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Methodologies**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning

# Key Findings
- **Production Growth**: Movie production increased nearly tenfold from ~2,500 films (1950) to ~24,000 films (2025)
- **Rating Stability**: Average IMDb rating remained remarkably stable at ~6.49 across decades
- **Budget-Revenue Correlation**: Strong positive correlation (0.895) between budget and revenue
- **ROI Insight**: No correlation between budget and ROI, indicating budget efficiency is independent of spending scale
- **Genre Trends**: Drama dominates production volume, but profitability is distributed across genres

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

# Model Performance
The Random Forest classifier was optimized using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The model categorizes movies into:
- **Hit**: High commercial success
- **Average**: Moderate performance
- **Flop**: Commercial failure

Key features for prediction include budget, genre, director track record, and IMDb ratings.
